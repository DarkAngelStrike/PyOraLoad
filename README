SOFTWARE:
    oraload.py

OVERVIEW:
    This is a super simple load testing tool for Oracle Database written in python.
    User can initiate pre-fixed INSERT/SELECT workload to the Oracle Database with arbitrary number of threads.
    Although setup of this tool is quite easy cause all you have to do is just run it like './oraload.py', I recommend you set 'sys_user' and 'sys_password' which you can see at the top section of the script file. By setting these parameters, oraload can create the required user and table for you.

USAGE:
    Refer to ./oraload.py --help
